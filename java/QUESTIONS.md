# Questions undoubtedly raised during the development process

We have to public methods in the CongestionTaxCalculator class:
getTax and getTollFee, so could We make getTollFee private, or the reason because It was made public
is that There is needed to expose both to the API?

For the bonus section the idea was to depreciate the evaluateTollFeeRuleInMemory and replace it by
the evaluateTollFeeRuleLoaded but something went wrong to be honest the time finished (4 hours) and
I left the code changes to keep the idea :) ... Ok it is done! I tried once and it worked
